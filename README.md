# 🏡 House Price Prediction  

This project is a **Machine Learning model to predict house prices** based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc. The goal is to build a predictive system that helps estimate property prices using regression techniques.

## 📌 Features  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Model training using regression algorithms  
- Performance evaluation with metrics such as **R² Score** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
- Prediction of house prices for new/unseen data

## 📊 Example Workflow  
1. Load dataset  
2. Perform EDA (visualize distributions, correlations)  
3. Preprocess and clean data (handle missing values, outliers, encoding)  
4. Train ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
5. Evaluate performance  
6. Predict house prices for test samples
